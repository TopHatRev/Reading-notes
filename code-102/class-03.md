### Version Control

* Version control allows you to revert to previous versions of the same file.  

#### The types of version control:

> * Local Version Control. An LVC is a database stored on your local computer.  
>
> * Centralised Version Control. A CVC is one database stored on a single server that allows multiple clients to access it at the same time, this makes collaboration viable.  
>
> * Distributed Version Control. This is similar to a CVC but it is a more secure system, the event of a server being corrupted for a CVC is devastating, a DVC allows for mirroring and multiple storage spaces.  

#### Cloning

Cloning repositories allows you to pull down your work on GitHub into your local machine to work on it more accurately.
