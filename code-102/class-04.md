### Wire framing has numerous important steps.  

* Research, sell to your audience, not to your preference. Look at examples of successful modern websites and try and make your designs timeless.

* Don't think that your first idea is going to stick, you make have to mock up a wireframe a dozen times before it works.

* After you have a basic frame you're happy with, add detailed sections like the menu and search bars at the top.

* Make your wireframes clear about what website they are portraying, where things are, what they are, not everyone can see your vision.

* An easy to navigate UI/UX gives a customer confidence that you are to be trusted with whatever service you provide.

* Keep it simple, overcrowding your page with information can make it difficult to navigate and to look at.
